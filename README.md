> A parallelized Sudoku solver implemented with various solving algorithms in C++.

### Introduction
Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzle games of all time.
The objective of Sudoku is to fill a _n_-by-_n_ grid with digits from 1 to _n_ such that each column, row, and box (or called "subgrid", "region", "block") contain every number in the set {1, ... , _n_} exactly once.

---

### Motivation
This project aims to implement a Sudoku solver that could solve **large** (e.g., 16-by-16, 25-by-25) Sudoku puzzles as efficiently as possible by means of various parallelization techniques and solving algorithms.
The details of implementation and performance results are explained in depth in the [project report](./Project_Report.pdf).

### How to use the code?
* #### Compile
    1. Navigate to the project root directory where the `Makefile` is located.
    2. Build the program by running the command:
        ```bash
        $ make
        ```
    3. An executable named `sudoku_main` will appear in the project root directory. 

* #### Run
    To run the solver, supply the executable with command-line arguments for test cases, modes, number of threads and flag for writing solution to a text file.
    ```bash
    $ ./sudoku_main <PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE> <MODE> <NUM_THREADS> [<WRITE_TO_SOLUTION_TXT>]
    ```
    ‚úèÔ∏è Note:
    - `<PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE>` (string): the path to the test case file (e.g., `Test_Cases/9x9_easy.txt`)
    - `<MODE>` (int): the mode to run the Sudoku solver
        + 0: sequential mode with backtracking algorithm
        + 1: sequential mode with brute-force algorithm
        + 2: parallel mode with brute-force algorithm
        + 3: sequential mode with DLX algorithm
        + 4: parallel mode with DLX algorithm
    - `<NUM_THREADS>` (int): if you set 2 or 4 for `<MODE>`, you need to also set `<NUM_THREADS>` (default = 2)
    - `<WRITE_TO_SOLUTION_TXT>` (int):
        + 0 (default): only print solution to the console 
        + 1: also write solution to a text file called `solution.txt` under the project root directory

### Demonstration
There are many different mode options available for this software. Two of them are shown as follows for demonstration purpose:

- #### Sequential mode for brute-force algorithm

- #### Parallel mode for brute-force algorithm

### Test cases
A collection of test grids of various sizes and difficulty levels are present in the [`Test_Cases`](./Test_Cases) directory.
